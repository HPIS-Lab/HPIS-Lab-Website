**Bio**<br>
Jack Lanciano is an Advanced Science (Computing) student at Curtin University. He has had previous experience as a business owner in Sandy Cracks Clothing, Star Skills Swimming and more. He is using his degree to help develop his next business idea. RideHub: a motorcycle safety, communication and ride management platform.  
<br><br>

**Current Project Description**<br>
  RideHub is a mobile application for motorcyclists. It works as an alternative and an improvement to helmet intercom systems, automatically enhancing and adjusting each user's voice to minimise background noise while riding. Although expensive intercoms are preferred, they aren't required, simply use ordinary earbuds as a cheaper alternative. 
  <br>
  RideHub features an interactive map, when combined with a motorcycle phone mount, allows the rider to explore the best routes in their area with friends or new riders. The app includes various safety features such as motorcycle specific hazard warnings and crash detection to make riding safer. Users can track their rides and save their favourite routes. The app is packed with many other useful features.
  <br>
  Riding is a dangerous sport with a passionate community of riders. It has a social element that is hindered by the challenges of communication and coordination. RideHub makes it easier to spontaneously connect and ride with anyone nearby. RideHub makes group riding much easier to coordinate, ensuring no one gets lost. Those who do not wish to voice chat can use RideHub to quickly and efficiently relay key information to the group, no more confusing hand signals!
